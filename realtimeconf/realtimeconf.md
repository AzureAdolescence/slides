- these won't make much sense without the video

Non-Blocking Workflows

- first: everything I've learned about node (cliffs notes)
- a good package manager unlocks magic community powers
- make publishing easy + rewarding
- when authoring: don't do too much
- decreased technical debt, increased reliability -> more dependents
- more dependents -> more agency -> robust ecosystem
- testling-ci, nodei.co, david-dm
- npm install, npm test
- npm install, npm start
- automate everything but don't be greedy with abstractions
- solving a complex problem should mean that dozens of new github repos get created by more than 1 author
- readmes: title, description, badges, install, example, api, contributing, license
- "An API is intuitive if reading the name tells you what it is, and require('whatevers') in the REPL tells you how to use it." - @izs
- "complements such as 'intuitive' should be left for others to make, otherwise you commit the sin of marketing" - @dominictarr
- conflict? may the best fork win
- open source is the default for many for-profit companies
- modules and repos are currency
- problem: node lives in the future!
- what if everyone worked this way?
- case study: open data
- open data tools are at a level comparable to source code management before version control
- data on the web is rarely syncable
- PDX API
- worked for consuming but lacked tools for collaboration (not distributed)
- dat
- goal: one click sync
