# Part One

# State of the Packages

# a good package manager unlocks magic community powers

# node is less interesting than npm
- node core is a handful of fast APIs for common protocols
- npm is where you can put anything, and anyone can depend on it

# decreased technical debt, increased reliability -> more dependents
# more dependents -> more agency -> robust ecosystem

# testling-ci.com, nodei.co, david-dm.org

# npm install, npm test
# npm install, npm start

# the law of the land of moduletopia:

# automate everything but don't be greedy with abstractions

# solving a complex problem
# should mean that dozens of new github repos get created by more than 1 author

# good readmes

# "An API is intuitive if reading the name tells you what it is, and require('whatevers') in the REPL tells you how to use it." - @izs

# "complements such as 'intuitive' should be left for others to make, otherwise you commit the sin of marketing" - @dominictarr

# may the best fork win

# <code>var myJavaScript = require('yourCoffeeScript');</code>

# problem: node lives in the future!

# open government

# procurement

# what if everyone worked this way?

# case study: open data

# open data tools are at a level comparable to source code management before version control

# data on the web is rarely syncable

# goal: one click sync
